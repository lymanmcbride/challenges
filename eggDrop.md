A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking.

```python
while eggCount < 1:
    #half sort. drop egg at half way up, and go up from there
    #when egg cracks, go back down to last floor where egg didn't crack and increment by two. If egg cracks, you know that it was the previous floor. probably. maybe you technically have to increment by 1
if eggCracks:
    #go from bottom, you've eliminated half the data
```
